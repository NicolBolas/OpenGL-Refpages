= Tools for converting DocBook to AsciiDoc

This file contains the tools that were used to do the initial automatic conversion to AsciiDoc. Note that these tools are here for development purposes and are *not complete*. This conversion process will undoubtedly be arcane and require tools that won't be listed here, since it is not meant to be done by anyone other than myself.

What follows is some information about the attempts to automatically convert DocBook to AsciiDoc.

== Information Not Converted By Pandoc

* The title/short description
* The function synopsis section
* Some inline math functions (delimited by `$` characters in a paragraph without any XML or latexmath: markup).
* Any `+citerefentry+` cross-links.
* Versions.
* Inclusions of tables.

Necessary tools:

* Conversion for the DocBook XML files:
** Pandoc DocBook 5 to AsciiDoc.
** Extract the title/description to a separate file.
** Extract the function synopsis section to a separate file.
* Search DocBook XML files:
** All `+citerefentry+` cross-links and the files they come from.
** All `xi:include`sions.
* Search AsciiDoc output:
** Find files containing `+$...$+` that are not prefixed by `+latexmath:+` notation.
* Transformations for Pandoc output files:
** Convert Pandoc output to more standard block notation `+= title+` rather than `title\n-----` notation.
** Remove everything before the "Parameters" section.
** Prepend any `+latexmath:[+` tags with `+[eq]+`.
** Merge the direct Pandoc outputs with the ancillary files generated from DocBook.
* Generate an index page.

== Pandoc to Initial DocBook XML

This tool takes a source directory and a destination directory.

For each "*.xml" file in the source directory, perform the following action:

* Parse the file as XML, without XInclusion.
* If the root element is `refentry`:
** Store the filename in the list of source files.
** From the `refnamediv` element, build a proper AsciiDoc header string. Store this alongside the file.
** From the `refsynopsisdiv` element, build the function synopsis section. Store this alongside the file.
** Find any `citerefentry` elements, extract their text and the text of what they link to, and store this alongside the file.
** Find any `xi:include` elements, extract their target files, and store them alongside the file.
** Perform the Pandoc conversion of the file to the destination directory. Store the name of the destination file alongside the file.
* If the root element is anything else:
** Store this (source) filename in a list of included files.
** Perform the Pandoc conversion of the file to the destination directory. The name of the destination file should be prefixed by `inc_`.
