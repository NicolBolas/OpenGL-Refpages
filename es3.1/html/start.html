<h1> OpenGL&reg; ES 3.1 Reference Pages </h1>

<p> Use the index on the left to choose any OpenGL ES reference page for
    viewing. These pages include all of the important usage information for
    each command. This information includes a description of all parameters,
    return values, error conditions, related commands and functions, and
    version support. </p>

<p> There are two forms of the index which can be selected by clicking at
    the top of the navigation bar on the left side: a traditional flat index
    combining the API commands and GLSL functions, and an accordion-style
    index with separate sections for commands and functions. The flat index
    also includes per-letter section links. </p>


<h2> Browser Compatibility </h2>

<p> Very old browsers, such as IE8, may not work with parts of this site.
    Please use modern browsers supporting HTML5 (e.g. IE9 and later). </p>

<p> The ref pages are generated in HTML5 format with imbedded MathML, and
    rely on <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to render
    mathematical equations on browsers which do not natively support MathML.
    This should work on Chrome, Safari, and other browsers which don't
    support MathML natively. </p>


<h2> Downloading Man Page Sources </h2>

<p> The Docbook source for the reference pages is available from the <a
    href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Refpages"> OpenGL-Refpages
    </a> github repository. </p>


<h2> Feedback </h2>

<p> If you find any inaccuracies or typos in the reference pages, please
    file an issue (and, preferably, propose a pull request fixing the issue)
    in the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Refpages">
    OpenGL-Refpages </a> github repository. </p>
